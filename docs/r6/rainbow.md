# Rainbow Six Siege

The Rainbow Six Siege commands let you look up players from every platform and get their stats.

## Format guide

`<>` is for mandatory, `[]` is for optional, `{}` is for mandatory if not linked.

### Custom definitions

- `username` â†’ the username of the player you're looking up (if the username has any space, replace them with a percent sign (%)). If the user you want to look up has [linked](#r6-link) their account you can replace this with a Discord `@mention`. If you [linked](#r6-link) your account and you want to see your stats leave this blank, the bot will automatically use your linked account.
- `platform` â†’ the platform the account belongs to; it could be either `uplay` (for pc), `xbl` or `psn`. If you leave this blank, the bot will automatically use `uplay` as the default. If you use a linked profile, whether for another user or yourself, you can leave this blank.
- `weaponName`, `weaponType` and `operator` â†’ these are names of weapons, weapon categories and operators: you can find a the acceptable names in this [cheat sheet](/r6/r6_names).
- `playType`: either `pvp` or `pve`. If you see `playType | all` that means that you can also use `all`, and it will show stats for both play types.
