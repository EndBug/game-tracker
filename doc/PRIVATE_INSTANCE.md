# How to setup a private instance
### Environment
You'll first need to install Node.js and npm to your local machine:

 - Go to Node.js' [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
 - Click and download the LTS installer for your operating system (npm should be included in the bundle).
 - Check the installation by opening the terminal and running `node -v` and `npm --version`.

### Bot

 - Clone this repository using [git](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
 - Run `npm i` to install the required packages.
 - Create a `.env` file with your tokens (you can find a model in [`.env-model`](../.env-model)). Please note that `BACKUP` and `DBL_TOKEN` are only used by the public bot: those functionalities are built for the bot and its server, if you want to make them work with yours you'll need to edit the code; you can avoid writing them.
 - If you want the bot to reload every time you edit a file, run `npm run dev`. If you jsut want the bot to start, run `npm run start`.
